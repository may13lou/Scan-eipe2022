        <string name="BeefWellingtonCookingTime">COOKING TIME: 1.5 hours</string>
        <string name="BeefWellingtonIngredients">INGREDIENTS:"
        Beef-Tenderloin (3 pounds)
        Prociutto (10 slices)
        Portobello (12 ounces)
        Shallot (1 whole)
        Olive Oil (12 tablespoons)
        Clove (2 whole)
        Thyme (2 teaspoon)
        Dry Vermouth (1 tablespoon)
        Dijon Mustard (2 tablespoon)
        Egg (1 whole)
        Puff Pastry (2 tablespoon)
        Unsalted Butter (2 tablespoon)" </string>
        <string name="BeefWellingtonRecipe">Make the stir fry sauce first. Combine the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and cornstarch in a small bowl. Set the sauce aside.Chop the vegetables into similar-sized pieces. It is up to you whether you slice, dice, or cut into any other shape you prefer. Add the cooking oil to a very large skillet or wok. Heat over medium-high. When the pan and oil are very hot (but not smoking), add the hardest vegetables first: carrots and broccoli. Cook and stir for about a minute, or just until the broccoli begins to turn bright green. Next, add the mushrooms and sugar snap peas. Continue to cook and stir for a minute or two more, or just until the mushrooms begin to soften. Finally, add the softest vegetables, bell pepper and onion. Continue to cook and stir just until the onion begins to soften. Give the stir fry sauce another brief stir, then pour it over the vegetables. Continue to cook and stir until the sauce begins to simmer, at which point it will thicken and turn glossy. Remove the vegetables from the heat, or continue to cook until they are to your desired doneness. Top the stir fry with sesame seeds and serve!</string>    <string name="BellCookingTime">COOKING TIME: 25 minutes</string>    <string name="BellIngredients">INGREDIENTS:"
        Bell Pepper (2 whole)
        Vegetable Oil (1 tablespoon)
        Chili Powder (1/4 teaspoon)
        Grounded Cumin (1/4 teaspoon)
        Grounded Beef (4 ounces)
        Shredded Mexican Blend Cheese (1 cup)
        Guacamole (1/4 cup)
        Pico-de-Gallo (1/4 cup)
        Sour Cream (2 tablespoons)" </string>

        <string name="BellRecipe">Cut the bell peppers through the stem into sixths, remove the stem and seeds. Transfer to a large microwave safe bowl, add a splash of water and a pinch of salt. Cover and microwave until the pepper pieces are pliable, about 4 minutes. Let cool slightly and then arrange close together on a foil-lined baking sheet, cut sides-up.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chili powder and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant and toasted, about 30 seconds. Add the ground beef and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and breaking up into bite-size pieces, until browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes.
Preheat the broiler. Spoon some beef mixture onto each pepper piece. Sprinkle with cheese and broil until the cheese melts, about 1 minute. Top with dollops of guacamole and pico de gallo. Thin the sour cream out with a little water and drizzle over the nachos.</string>    <string name="StirfryTime">COOKING TIME: 25 minutes</string>    <string name="StirfryIngredients">INGREDIENTS:"
